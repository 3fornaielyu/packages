## Features
 
The main features of Age of Mythology Extended Edition Tale of the Dragon v2.7 PC are:
 
- A new civilization: The Chinese, who have unique units, buildings, technologies, and god powers. The Chinese can choose from three major gods: Fu Xi, NÃ¼ Wa, and Shennong, each with their own bonuses and myth units. The Chinese also have generals who can boost the morale of nearby units and war academies that can research special upgrades.
- A new campaign: Tale of the Dragon, which consists of 10 scenarios that follow the story of General Jiao-Long as he tries to restore harmony to China after Yin and Yang are shattered. The campaign is fully voice-acted in English and features new characters, locations, and challenges.
- New maps: The expansion adds 10 new maps to the game, some based on real-world locations like the Great Wall of China and the Yellow River, and some inspired by Chinese mythology like Mount Kunlun and Nine Palaces.
- New god powers: The Chinese gods have access to new god powers that can unleash natural disasters like tsunamis, infernos, geysers, or arrow barrages on their enemies or aid their allies with blessings like imperial examination or year of the goat.
- New myth units: The Chinese mythology is rich with fantastical creatures that can be summoned by the Chinese gods. Some of these include the Jiangshi, an undead unit that drains life from enemy soldiers; the Vermilion Bird, a fiery phoenix that can resurrect itself; the Qilin, a benevolent unicorn that can heal friendly units; and the Dilong, an earth dragon that can burrow underground and surprise attack enemies.

## Gameplay
 
The gameplay of Age of Mythology Extended Edition Tale of the Dragon v2.7 PC is similar to the original game, with some tweaks and additions. The game is still based on gathering resources (food, wood, gold, and favor), building a base, advancing through four ages (Archaic, Classical, Heroic, and Mythic), training an army, researching technologies, and defeating enemies. The game can be played in single-player mode against AI opponents or in multiplayer mode against other players online or locally.
 
The main difference between Tale of the Dragon and the previous expansions is the introduction of the Chinese civilization, which has its own strengths and weaknesses. The Chinese are a versatile civilization that can adapt to different situations and strategies. They have access to a wide range of units, from infantry to cavalry to siege weapons to monks. They also have some unique mechanics that make them stand out from other civilizations.
 
One of these mechanics is the Yin Yang balance system, which affects how much favor (a resource used to summon myth units and god powers) the Chinese can generate. The Chinese can generate favor by building gardens or by killing enemy units. However, they also have to maintain a balance between Yin and Yang by choosing different minor gods in each age. Each minor god belongs to either Yin or Yang faction and grants different bonuses and myth units. If the Chinese choose
